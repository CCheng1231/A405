   Chemical potential
     *symbol*: :math:`\mu`--
     *units*: energy/particle
     *Definition*: The potential that a substance has to produce in order to 
     	alter a system. It is defined as:
			:math:`\mu \equiv -T (ds/dN)`

     

   esat
     *symbol*: :math:`e_s` --
     *units*: :math:`Pa`  -- 
     *Notes*: `vapor notes`_ --  
     *Text*: p. 80-82
	 *Definition*: `Otherwise know as the saturation vapor pressure. 
		The pressure exerted by the water vapor at the point of saturation.
		Saturation is defined when the rate of condensation is equal to the rate of evaporation.`

    entropy
     *symbol*: :math:`s` --
     *units*: :math:`J kg^{-1} K^{-1}`  -- 
     *Notes*: `entropy and equivalent temperature notes`_ --  
     *Text*: p. 100-101


   equivalent potential temperature
     *symbol*: :math:`\theta_e` --
     *units*: K --
     *Notes*: `entropy and equivalent temperature notes`_ -- 
     *Text*: p. 85

   helmholtz free energy
     *symbol*: :math: `f` --
     *units*: J --
     *Text*: p 111 (see also any statistical or thermal physics text book)
     *Definition*:  :math:`f \equiv u - Ts` where u is the internal energy, T is
     	the temperature and s is the entropy (see above definition). When 
	considering energy conservation of one or more systems at a constant 
	temperature it is more useful to look at the Free Energy rather than the
	Internal Energy.
     

   internal energy
     *symbol*: :math:`u` --
     *units*: J/kg --
     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ -- 
     *Text*: p. 72
     *Definition*: Kinetic and potential energy of a system's molecules and
        atoms (doesn't count the kinetic energy of the system moving
        as a unit, or the potential energy due to movement in an
        external gravitational or electromagnetic field

   moist static energy
     *symbol*: :math:`h_m` or :math:`h_{mse}` --
     *units*: :math:`J kg^{-1}`  -- 
     *Notes*: `moist static energy notes`_
     *Text*: p. 86

   quadratic degree of freedom
     *Definition*: A degree of freedom is quadratic if the energy terms 
     	associated to this degree of freedom can be written as:
			E = :math:`aX^2 + bXY'
	Where the square on the X term indicates the quadratic degrees of 
	freedom. This means that they system has two degrees of freedom.
	 
   wsat
     *symbol*: :math:`w_s` --
     *units*: :math:`kg/kg`  -- 
     *Notes*: `vapor notes`_ --  
     *Text*: p. 82
	 *Definition*: `Otherwise know as the saturation mixing ratio. 
		The ratio of the mass of saturated water vapor over mass of dry air.`

   virtual temperature 
     *symbol*: :math: `T_v' --
     *units*: :math: `K` --
     *Notes*: 
     *Text*: p. 66
     *Definition*: `The temperature of dry air at the pressure and density of a sample of moist air.`

   virtual potential temperature
     *symbol*: :math: `\theta_v` --
     *units*: `K` --
     *Notes*: 
     *Text*: 
     *Definition*: `The potential temperature of dry air at the density of a sample of moist air.`
